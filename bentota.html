    <p class="bentotapara">The Bentota Turtle Hatchery serves as a ray of hope for sea turtles that are in risk of extinction. It is located in the charming coastal town of Bentota, Sri Lanka. These amazing aquatic species are the focus of this extraordinary conservation facility, which also provides rehabilitation and release services. Visitors can observe the laborious efforts made at the hatchery to protect turtle species, learn about their biology, and become aware of the environmental difficulties they encounter. The committed staff and volunteers gather and protect endangered turtle eggs, ensuring a secure environment for incubation until the hatchlings emerge. The newborn turtles are raised until they are healthy and strong before being released into the huge ocean, where they can flourish and support the fragile marine ecosystem. A prime example of peaceful coexistence is the Bentota Turtle Hatchery.</p>
