        Turtle Population In Srilanka &#8594;
      
    </h2>
        <p class="sectiononepara">DIFFERENT SPECIES: Today there are 250 species of turtles on earth. Seven of these live in the ocean and are called sea turtles. The remaining 243 species live on land or in freshwater ponds and marshes. The terrestrial turtles, those that live solely on land, are called tortoises.
  
            Five of the seven species of sea turtles in the world visit the shores of Sri Lanka to breed. They are the Green Turtle (Chelonia mydas), Hawksbill Turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata), Olive Ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea), Loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and Leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea). The sea turtles are called Kesbawa in Sinhala and Amai in Tamil.
            
            There are three species of freshwater turtles and one terrestrial tortoise in Sri Lanka. The freshwater turtles are Parker's Black Turtle (Melanochelys trijuga pakeri) Sri Lanka Black Turtle (Melanochelys trijuga thermalis) and the Soft or Flapshell turtle (Lissemys punctata punctata). The terrestrial tortoise is the Star tortoise (Geochelone elegans).</p>

       <p>The Pleurodira are one of the two living suborders of turtles, Cryptodira. The division between these two suborders represents a very deep evolutionary divide between two very different types of turtles</p>

       <p>The Cryptodira are a suborder of includes most living tortoises and turtles. Cryptodira differ from Pleurodira in that they lower their heads straight back into the shells, the body under the shells' marginals</p>

     <p>Terrapins are one of several small species of turtle (order Testudines) living in fresh or brackish water. Terrapins do not form a taxonomic unit and may not be closely related.</p>

       <p>LTortoises are reptiles of the family Testudinidae of the order Testudines. Like other turtles, tortoises have a shell to protect from predation and other threats Tortoises tend to stay at one place, while turtles are likely to move around in search of food, even swimming oceans</p>

           <p>Sea turtles are characterized by a large, streamlined shell and non-retractile head and limbs. Unlike other turtles, sea turtles cannot pull their limbs and head inside their shells.  so they are vulnerable while on land</p>

                    <p class="sectiontwopara">
                      Major changes have occurred in the oceans because sea turtles have been virtually eliminated from many areas of the globe. Commercial fishing, loss of nesting habitat and climate change are among the human-caused threats pushing sea turtles towards extinction. As sea turtle populations decline, so does their ability to fulfillvital functions in ocean ecosystems.

                        <p class="sectiontwopara">Healthy oceans need sea turtles. Sea turtles are a "keystone species", which means they are an important part of their environment and influence other species around them. If a keystone species is removed from a habitat, the natural order can be disrupted, which impacts other wildlife and fauna in different ways.
                          Sea turtles have played vital roles in maintaining the health of the world's oceans for more than 100 million years. These roles range from maintaining productive coral reef ecosystems to transporting essential nutrients from the oceans to beaches and coastal dunes.
                           Turtles are important as scavengers, herbivores, carnivores and often contribute significant biomass to the ecosystems. They break down the energy of plant materials and convert them into protein.
