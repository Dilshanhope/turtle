       Hikkaduwa Turtle Hatchery
    </h2>
        <p class="sectionthreepara">Turtle farm in Hikkaduwa or Sea Turtle Hatchery & Rescue Center is a small and yet a very nice turtle farm and rescue center. Here visitors may see turtle eggs which are safely buried in the sand hatchery. It usually takes two days for eggs to hatch. Turtles are held really gently with great attention to their proper development so that they can later be safely released into the sea where they can live in their natural habitat. This is the reason why here visitors can see  turtles in many different sizes; turtles need to grow in order to be released and continue living on their own, types of sea turtles Leatherback, Loggerhead, Olive Ridley, Green Turtle & Hawksbill live mostly in Hikkaduwa.</p>

<h2>Kosgoda Beach</h2>
<p class="sectionthreepara">Kosgoda is the one of the very few hatcheries where all the five species in the country make their nests. They are the Olive Ridleys, Leatherbacks, Green Turtles, Loggerheads and Hawksbills They start with keeping an eye on the nesting mother turtles, bringing their eggs to the secure environment of the hatchery and finally releasing the baby turtles into the sea on the day of their birth. However, if there are complications, they tend to them and release them only once they're fit to go into the vast ocean, Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery. Here's a welfare center that genuinely cares about these little creatures, even before they're born

These turtles frequent the warm waters of the southern coast, especially along the coast between Unawatuna and Mirissa where they come ashore to nest</p>
