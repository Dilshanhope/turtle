           Threats To Turtles
        </h2>

            <p class="sectionthreatpara1">Over the last 200 years, human activities have tipped the scales against the survival of these ancient mariners. Slaughtered for their eggs, meat, skin, and shells, sea turtles suffer from poaching and over-exploitation. They also face habitat destruction and accidental capture known as bycatch in fishing gear, Expert members of the IUCN-SSC Marine Turtle Specialist Group have identified five major threats to sea turtles worldwide: fisheries bycatch, coastal development, pollution and pathogens, direct take, and climate change.Along with fishing gear and climate change, there are numerous human activity threats to sea turtles. These threats include coastal development, pollution, direct harvest, invasive species and vessel strikes.</p>

            <h2>Turtels Eating Plastics</h2>
<br>


<p>Sharp plastics can rupture internal organs and bags can cause intestinal blockages leaving turtles unable to feed, resulting in starvation. Even if they survive, consuming plastic can make turtles unnaturally buoyant, which can stunt their growth 
and lead to slow reproduction rates, Plastic in an animal's gut can prevent food 
digestion and can lead to a very slow and painful death. As plastic bags can take up to 1,000 years to break down, once an animal dies and decays after ingesting plastic, the plastic is then freed back into the marine environment to carry on killing other wildlife.</p>

<h2>Fisheries Bycatch</h2>
<br>

<p>Fishermen sometimes catch and discard animals they do not want, cannot sell, or are not allowed to keep. This is collectively known as “bycatch.” Bycatch can be fish, but also includes other animals such as dolphins, whales, sea turtles, and seabirds that become hooked or entangled in fishing gear, 
    What is Bycatch? Understanding and Preventing Fishing Bycatch
    Longlines, trawling and the use of gillnets are the fishing methods that most commonly result in bycatch.While most bycatch research occurs in marine systems, freshwater bycatch is an understudied yet likely important threat</p>

        Consequences and how we can prevent Turtles from Threats
    </h2>

    <p class="sectionthreatpara2">Luckily most turtles have a hard shell that helps protect them from predators. One of the main differences between sea turtles and other types of turtles is that sea turtles can't pull their limbs into their shells like other species can, Solid waste, chemicals and pollutants from human activities enter the ocean, causing injury, illness and even death to sea turtles. The pollution sources range from wastewater discharge released by cruise liners to fishing nets that are lost by fishermen to fertilizer runoff that comes down rivers from farms.Marine pollution is both directly harmful to sea turtles as well as indirectly, through the deterioration of their natural habitats. Some of the most dangerous ocean pollutants include toxic metals, PCBs, fertilizers, untreated waste, chemicals, and a variety of petroleum products.All turtles may bite if they are harassed or feel threatened. Two species that are especially prone to biting are the snapping turtle (which is found in most water bodies throughout the state) and spiny softshell which is found in most water bodies aside from wetlands and ponds throughout.</p>
