    <p class="kosgodapara">Here you will find lots of information about Sri Lanka's pioneering sea turtle conservation project - why Sri Lanka (and the village of Kosgoda in particular) is a prime turtle nesting site, why the conservation project is needed and how the project is operated by local people with the help of international volunteers, Kosgoda is the one of the very few hatcheries where all the five species in the country make their nests. They are the Olive Ridleys, Leatherbacks, Green Turtles, Loggerheads and Hawksbills. It is one of the 18 hatcheries in Sri Lanka devoted to the proper breeding of this endangered species. Visitors can get to see up to five endangered species out of seven species of margin turtles in the world here. The place is especially suitable for kids but provides to be a once in a lifetime experience for all.</p>
